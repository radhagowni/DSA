# DSA
This repository contains implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms problems in Java,Python,C++.
It is designed to practice core programming concepts,strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.


# Fibonacci 

Inorder to find the value at given position in the fibonacci series, many approches are there.
Fibonacci_approch_1,Fibonacci_approch_2,Fibonacci_approch_3 are  3 different solutions tha we can make use of them.

# Exclusion product

We have two solutions here to find Exclusion product.
Approach 1 gives O(n*n) time complexity.
Inorder to reduce the time complexity of approach 1,we came up with a optimised solution which is approach 2.
